This folder will contain all the projects i made during my learning process from some course. 
These projects will be made based on lectures i took or materials provided in class or the course or ones I got free unity Asset store.It will only contain the free assets.
These projects may not be complete projects as they will only contain enough parts so that specific things can be learned during its creation process.
Basically they would have some specific game concepts but may not be a complete game on its own. Like having its own UI, Music, effects etc.
Do tell me if there are any problems with my references to the owners of orignal assets.
